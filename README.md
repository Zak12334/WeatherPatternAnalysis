# WeatherPatternAnalysis
Python Script that analyses wheather patterns with visual graphs. 

Task 1: Identifies unique locations in the dataset and visualizes the five locations with the fewest records, highlighting geographical data distribution.
Task 2: Analyzes the relationship between atmospheric pressure differences and subsequent rainfall, visualizing the impact of pressure changes on weather predictions.
Task 3: Employs a Decision Tree Classifier to determine the importance of various meteorological features in predicting rain, illustrating the results through feature importance graphs.
Task 4: Compares classification models based on different weather parameters to predict rainfall, assessing model accuracy and generalization.
Task 5: Investigates wind direction patterns using the Decision Tree and K-Neighbors classifiers, displaying accuracy results through cross-validation.
Task 6: Applies K-Means clustering to explore inherent groupings within the weather data, using the Elbow Method for optimal cluster determination.
Task 7: Conducts an additional K-Means clustering on wind speed patterns, providing insights into daily variations visualized through PCA components.
Each task is designed to provide insightful analyses into specific features of the dataset, using a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The project not only aims to uncover underlying patterns in weather data but also to demonstrate the application of various Python libraries in real-world data science scenarios.
